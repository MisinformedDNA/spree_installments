Extend better-paypal-expresss
=========================
- We need to extend better-paypal-express gem to include recurring profile capability.
- It has already those via 'paypal-sdk-merchant' gem. We just need to expose it.


On App side (initial purchase amount + recurring profile)
==========================================================
- We have case of mix purchased one-time purchase + recurring profile
- implement recurring profile
- Than include initial purchase
- Reports will be fetched from Paypal using IPN.
- Done
